# 🎬 HR Compliance Animation – Created Using Vyond

## 📌 Project Overview

This project showcases an animated HR compliance awareness video created using **Vyond**.
The objective of this video is to demonstrate the importance of integrity in hiring practices through scenario-based storytelling.

Instead of presenting policy content in static text format, the learning experience is delivered through animated characters, workplace situations, and consequence-driven storytelling to improve engagement and retention.
